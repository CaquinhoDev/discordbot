# discordbot
 a bot for discord (still in the testing phase) that can disguise itself as a normal user, as the bot tag will not appear.
 
 the code is almost ready to use. All you need to do is, if necessary, change the "chromewebdriver.exe" file to the version of your browser. It is already updated, but if necessary, change it. Also change your discord email and password in the code (lines 31 and 35).

 you can find the chromedriver version on the website:
